Do you ‚ô•Ô∏è using ObjectBox?
==========================
We want to [hear about your app](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIYiOIThcq-AnDVoCvnZOMgxO4S-fBtDSFPQfWldJnhi2c7Q/viewform)!
It will - literally - take just a minute, but help us a lot. Thank you!‚Äã üôè‚Äã

ObjectBox Swift
===============

ObjectBox is a superfast, light-weight object persistence framework.
This Swift API seamlessly persists objects on-device for iOS and macOS.

```swift
let santa = Person(firstName: "Santa", lastName: "Claus")
try personBox.put(santa)

let query: Query<Person> = personBox.query {
    return (Person.firstName.contains("Santa") || Person.age > 100)
           && Person.lastName.isEqual(to: "Claus") 
}.build()
let oldClauses = query.find()
```

Background: code generation
---------------------------
ObjectBox Swift generates code at build time for optimal performance at runtime by avoiding reflection etc.
This is automatically done for you and should be transparent.
Internally, we use [a fork of Sourcery](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift-generator) for this.

Source code
-----------
Source code for ObjectBox's Swift binding can be found [in the Source folder](Sources).

Other languages/bindings
------------------------
ObjectBox is a multi platform database supporting [multiple languages](https://objectbox.io/dev-get-started/): 

* [ObjectBox Java](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java): runs on Android, desktop and servers.
* [ObjectBox Go](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go): great for data-driven tools and server applications. 
* [ObjectBox C](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c): native speed with zero copy access to FlatBuffer objects;
  also enables porting ObjectBox to other languages.
* [ObjectBox Dart/Flutter](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/): build cross-platform apps using Flutter (beta version)
